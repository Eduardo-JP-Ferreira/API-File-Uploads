## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to implement the following enhancements to further improve the application:

* **Frontend Integration:**
  - Develop a dedicated frontend to provide a user-friendly interface for file uploads.
  - Integrate the frontend with the existing backend to seamlessly interact with the file upload functionality.

* **Database Integration:**
  - Implement database storage for uploaded files to improve data management and retrieval.
  - Choose a suitable database solution (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and design the schema to store file-related information.
